# Analyzing Baselines for Hierarchical Attention Networks


Reproducibility (i.e., the ability for researchers to replicate others’ work) is a critical issue in machine learning, and there is a growing movement towards ensuring reproducible machine learning. In this mini-project, the goal is to reproduce and extend on results from papers that did not publish code.

### Track 1: Implement and improve the baselines
When researchers propose new models, they often spend more time on fine-tuning their proposed model than fine-tuning the baselines. Simple baselines like Naive Bayes, Random Forests, k-NN if properly tuned, can sometimes provide performances that are hard to beat. In this track, your goal will be to select a paper (e.g., from the list of suggested papers) and improve/analyze the baselines for the tasks considered in the paper. First implement (a subset of) the baseline(s) mentioned in the paper (without using the author’s code) and try to reproduce the baseline performance reported in the paper. Then try to fine-tune the baselines by doing extensive hyper-parameter tuning. Then, explore simple machine learning algorithms (e.g., discussed in the class) to improve the performance on the given task. Note that for some recent papers a simple/standard LSTM or CNN would count as a baseline. Your job is to act like an adversary to the paper and try to beat their performance by using simple algorithms that have less computational complexity. At a minimum, in this track you should reproduce at least one baseline proposed in the paper and implement one modified baseline of your own. An outstanding project in this track would perform a rigorous and extensive evaluation many simple baselines and/or propose a clever new baseline that achieves strong performance.
