# Mini-Project 4: Reproducible Machine Learning

Reproducibility (i.e., the ability for researchers to replicate othersâ€™ work) is a critical issue in machine learning, and there is a growing movement towards ensuring reproducible machine learning. In this mini-project, you will aim to reproduce the results of a published machine learning paper. There are two different tracks: the first track aims to reproduce and extend on results from papers that did not publish code, and the second track aims to use published code to reproduce and extend on an existing work.

Choose a paper from the following curated list: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SU2HWf6qOJXsQfaCmUJvS3KpaoFWxnXX6guI22-QSYQ/edit
